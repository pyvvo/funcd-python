"""The funcd Python function programming model (typed authoring contract).

A function module exports ``handle(context, event)``; the runtime shim invokes it once per
CloudEvent. Authors ``from funcd_shim import Handler, CloudEvent, FunctionContext`` for a typed
handler signature checked by ``mypy --strict`` — the same contract the shim enforces at runtime
(ADR-0049), mirroring ``@funcd/shim-nodejs``'s ``types.ts``.
