"""Path B function-log capture producer for the Python runtime shim (ADR-0081).

Python has no ``console`` (the Node Path B hook point), so the structured capture seam is a
``logging.Handler`` installed on the **root logger**: every ``logging.info(...)`` / ``logging.error(...)``
a function emits becomes one NDJSON record on a dedicated side channel that funcd reads host-side. A bare
``print(...)`` is intentionally **not** captured here — it falls to Path A (raw stdout, coarse ``INFO``).

The channel is selected once at startup from the environment (set by the funcd launch path, ADR-0011):

  - ``FUNCD_LOG_FD``   — a numeric fd (e.g. ``"3"``) funcd passed in (crun ``--preserve-fds``);
                         lines are written with a synchronous ``os.write`` (the crash-tail trade, ADR-0081).
  - ``FUNCD_LOG_SOCK`` — a Unix-domain socket path (containerd bind-mount); a connected ``AF_UNIX`` stream.
  - neither set       — no capture: ``install_log_capture()`` is a no-op and ``logging`` behaves normally.

The host ``Reader`` is language-agnostic: this emits the **same NDJSON wire** as the Node shim, only with
``"funcd.source": "logging"`` (vs Node's ``"console"``). One JSON object + ``"\n"`` per record. Stdlib only.
